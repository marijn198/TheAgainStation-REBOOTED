Sprint Planning:

Starting date: Monday 28/11/2016
Duration of the sprint:     1 week/7 days

Sprint Members:
    - Developers: Robin, Tim, Thomas, Jeroen, Marijn
    - Scrum Master: Job
    - Product Owners: R. Tangelder, A. Fiselier



1. What can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming sprint?

    - Documentation and libraries for the components we are using
    - Code snippets for the components we are using, the components should be able to output
      data with this code.



2. How will the chosen work get done?
    
    - The components are "assigned" between the project members, every member will execute the following steps
      regarding the component they got.
    - The documentation and libraries will be obtained by using trusted websites and other sources.

    - The code will be written by using pair programming, this means that the code that is written by someone,
      will be checked by their programming partner. This way we will maintain quality of code.
    - Every member has their own git branch, here they will store their code, so it can be viewed by others.
    - The product owners will both have access to the repository, so they can check the changes that are made.
    - Before the code gets pushed to the master branch, it will be checked by our "Git QA Tester", Thomas G.

    - The result of the code will be reviewed by the poduct owners on Monday 5/12/2016, when the sprint ends.

3. Sprint review.

    What will happen in the Sprint Review?
   
    - The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
    - The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
    - The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
    - The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed);
    - The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
    - Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,
    - Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.


4. Sprint Retrospective.

    What will be done in the Sprint Retrospective?

    - Held with the sprint team only.
    - Inspect and discuss how the last sprint went.
    - Identify what went well and what went wrong.
    - Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the scrum team does its work.
